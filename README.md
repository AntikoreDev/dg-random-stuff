# Duck Random Stuff
As of the recent events and the possible Duck Game's delisting from Steam in sight, I want to release this mod's source code to the public domain. I'm retired from Duck Game but I don't want this to be lost.

Freely you can fork and republish this mod as you wish. I cannot guarantee this mod is fully functional as it is right now. 

**Note:** This was the `dev` version which that means there are the latest changes not present in the published version

**Duck Game will be eternal, and [FUCK ZASLAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav)**

_This mod was made several years ago, code is very dirty and I know it._
